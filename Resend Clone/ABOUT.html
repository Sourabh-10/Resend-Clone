                <h1>BUILDING THE MODERN<br><span>EMAIL SENDING PLATFORM</span></h1>
                <p class="first-paragraph">The web has come a long way in the last ten years, but why is email stuck in the past?<br><span>
                  It doesn't have to be that way. We want to change that. We want to reimagine email.</span></p>
                <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                <p class="second-paragraph">Resend started with an open source project in 2022.
                  <br><span>We were frustrated by how difficult it was to build</span>
                  <br><span>modern email templates that worked well across all</span>
                  <br><span>email clients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="third-paragraph">As we started to dig deeper, it became clear that this<br> was just the tip of the iceberg. We realized that
                  <br>sending emails that reach the inbox (not the spam
                  <br>folder) was the biggest pain point, so we started to 
                  <br>explore something new.
                </p>
                <p class="fourth-paragraph">In 2023, we launched an entire email sending 
                  <br>platform and joined Y Combinator's winter batch.
                  <br>We're creating something special here, and we're 
                  <br>excited to build it with you.
                </p>
                <h3>THE TEAM BEHIND IT</h3>
                <p class="fifth-paragraph">A fully remote team on a mission to build
                  <br>the best communication platform for developers.

                <h4>WHAT WE BELIEVE</h4>
                <p class="sixth-paragraph">Principles that dictate how we think, behave, and make decisions.</p>

                <h5>Do work that inspires others</h5>
                <p class="seventh-paragraph">You can't inspire people by doing an “okay” job. To inspire, you need to do 
                <br>phenomenal work. Quality is not a plus; it's a must-have. We know nothing will
                <br>ever be perfect, but that doesn't stop us from pushing the limits. We don't
                <br>want to just meet the bar of our peers. We want to raise the bar. The sum of 
                <br>all the small details is what makes something special.

                <h6>No ego</h6>
                <p class="eight-paragraph">Helping others is part of the job. It's okay to admit you don't know something
                <br>and ask for help - it's a sign of strength, not weakness. We work together as 
                <br>an async team and assume positive intent. We communicate in a kind, direct, 
                <br>and transparent way.

              <p class="ninth-paragraph">Speed is key. We prioritize ruthlessly, have a strong sense of urgency, and 
              <br>make decisions fast. We constantly review the scope of a project and work
              <br>toward a v0, not a v1. We ship early, and we ship often.

              <br>Instead, we take initiative, find creative ways around it, and send a pull 
              <br>request to solve it. Remember - no problem is too small.
